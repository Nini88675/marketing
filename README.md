# this is our project for the topic 2. 
order of the py/ipynb : 
- Youtube_API file where we extract data and comments from youtube advertising vids of fast food, using the Youtube data api v3 device.
- Basic engagement file in which we create some basic metrics and putting comments in row, so we have two dataframe, one for the basic metrics and the other for comments
- GPT API file where we ask gpt via a code and a prompt to do some sentiment analysis of our extracted comments
- Metrics_Comments_Analysis where we compute metrics about the comments that were analysed by gpt and we have metrics such as top theme mentionned or the intent to purchase
- Google API file where we use the google api video intelligence to detect voice, text, colors, objects and changing scene from downloaded videos to create metrics related to the visual analysis

  For the moment we've regrouped all the metrics in 1 dataframe. We are creating an interactive dashboard and working for the final presentation
